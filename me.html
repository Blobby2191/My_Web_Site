	<p class="bigger summary">
		I was born in 2012, and I loved gaming and Watching TV more than everything else. Later I loved games so much, that I was inspired to make my own game, And that's when I learned coding!<br> Now my hobbies are Coding, Cooking, Gaming, Watching Television, Biking, Running, and Eating!
		My favorite of them is coding, and I'm also very interested in AI and Robotics.<br>
		I was taught from two schools called <a href="https://whitehatjr.com">WhiteHat Junior</a> and <a href="https://svrobotics.ca">SV robotics</a>.
		There I learned to create a few apps on <a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a> and <a href="https://thunkable.com">Thunkable</a>, as well as games and animations on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Now I am making websites like this one!!!<br> I also like seeing my friends at school, and my favorite subject is math! The things I don't like are being bullied, or being stressed. You could see MORE things I like down below.<br>
		My main goal is to get more fit, so it would be easier for me to run faster, or carry heavy stuff, and also so people stop teasing me beacause I'm fat! My favorite school is <a href="https://rcmschool.ca">Royal Cachet Montesorri School</a>, but I also learned from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Buttonville%20Public%20School">Buttonvile Public School</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Trinity%20Montessori%20School">Trinity Montessori school</a>.
